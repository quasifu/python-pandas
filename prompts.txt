Version 1:
Hi ChatGPT, I need to write a python application on Windows that can take an excel file (SimplySails.xlsx) and answer the following questions:
How many hours can each sailboat model go for before they need maintenance?
Which sailboat can go the longest without maintenance?
Which sailboat has the cheapest maintenance with the most hours on the water? Provide the data showing each sailboat model.

The data is broken into 3 worksheets:
Worksheet: Sailboat Activities
Columns: Boat Model, Serial Number, Date, Entry Type, Hours, Maintenance Session
------------------------------
Worksheet: Maintenance Sessions
Columns: Maintenance Session, Date, Boat Model, Serial Number, Maintenance Code
------------------------------
Worksheet: Maintenance Codes
Columns: Boat Model, Maintenance Code, Total Maintenance Cost ($)

Key callouts to keep in mind:
The Entry Type is either Sailing or Maintenance.  If its sailing, then its on the water.
Maintenance Session is a string identifier that allows us to look up the Maintenance Codes per session. 
Maintenance Codes tells us what the cost of the Maintenance Session was. 
The cost depends on the Boat Model.
The Boat Model column exists in all three worksheets.


Version 2:
Hi ChatGPT, I need to write a python application on Windows that can take an excel file (SimplySails.xlsx) in the same directory and answer the following questions:
How many hours can each sailboat model go for before they need maintenance?

Version 3 (Current):
Hi ChatGPT, I need to write a python application on Windows that can take an excel file (SimplySails.xlsx) in the same directory and answer the following questions:
Which boat has the most maintenance?

The data has a worksheet named Sailboat Activities.  It has the following columns: Boat Model, Serial Number, Date, Entry Type, Hours, Maintenance Session


Column Descriptions:
Boat Model is the type of boat and is not unique.
Serial Number is the unique identifier of each boat. 
Date is when the entry happened. 
Entry Type is either Sailing or Maintenance.  If its sailing, then its on the water.
Hours is either hours spent in Maintenance or hours spent sailing.  It depends on the Entry Type.
Maintenance Session is a unique identifier of the maintenance session.
